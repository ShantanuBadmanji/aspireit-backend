### Minutes of the Meeting

# updates:
1. Exposed API endpoints for ML Model POST /generate_questions and POST /evaluate_candidate_audio_response_for_given_question.
2. Implmented endpoints for /assessments and /assessments/{assessment_id} to get all assessments and a specific assessment respectively.
3. Implemented endpoints for /responses and /responses/{response_id} to get all responses and a specific response respectively.


## Discussion Points:
1. Implement async/await or multithreading in the model to reduce the time taken  to respond to the user.
2. Unable to interpreate the Analytics Entityset. Need to discuss with the team to understand the requirements. possible modifications to the ER diagram.
3. Possible creation of a new entityset to audio files seperate from the responses entityset. because the audio files are large so storing them in the same entityset as arrays is not a good idea.
